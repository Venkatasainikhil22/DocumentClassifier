**Project Name:** Document Recognition and Classification System

**Description:**

The Document Recognition and Classification System is an intelligent solution designed to automate the identification and categorization of various official documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The system analyzes input images of documents and extracts text information, employing correction mechanisms to enhance accuracy.

**Key Features:**

1. **Document Types:**
   - Pan Card
   - Aadhar Card
   - Driving Licence
   - Voter ID
   - Passport

2. **OCR and Text Correction:**
   - Utilizes OCR for text extraction from images.
   - Implements text correction mechanisms to improve accuracy and reliability.

3. **Classification and Reporting:**
   - Classifies documents based on recognized text content.
   - Provides detailed output, indicating the type of document identified.

4. **Efficiency and Automation:**
   - Streamlines document verification processes by automating recognition tasks.
   - Reduces manual effort and potential errors associated with document identification.

5. **Extendable and Customizable:**
   - Designed for easy integration of additional document types.
   - Customizable to accommodate specific business or organizational requirements.

**How to Use:**

1. Upload an image containing text from an official document.
2. The system will recognize and correct the text content.
3. It will then classify the document into one of the predefined types.
4. Output includes a summary of the identified document type.

**Potential Use Cases:**
- Streamlining KYC (Know Your Customer) processes.
- Enhancing document management in government or organizational settings.
- Automating verification procedures for financial transactions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries (e.g., EasyOCR).
